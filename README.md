# python-api-challenge

This is an exercise on APIs using python.

In Part 1, we are modelling weather around the Earth by the Northern and the Southern hemispheres. We are using linear
regression to model Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness and Wind Speed against the Latitudes of the two hemispheres.

In Part 2, we are generating random latitude, longitude locations around the Earth and visualizing those locations using
the geoViews python library. Then we narrow down our list using some restrictions on the temperature, wind speed and 
cloudiness for the purpose of identifying best weather-friendly places for vacation. Then we use the Geoapify API to find
hotels within a desired radius around each of the identified places. Lastly, we add the Country name and the hotel names
associated with the identified places. These information are displayed on the hover message on the geoViews map.

Outputs: The results from both the parts are included in the output_data folder.

NOTE: I have worked on this assignment alone. However, I have consulted with the learning assistants 2 to 3 times to clarify
the assignment and debug my code.
